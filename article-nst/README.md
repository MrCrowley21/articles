## Getting Started

For this project, we will be using Google colab. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Open colab**: Open the following notebook:

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SConrCEivmXGin4xmheRX04H8IfGIOFG?usp=sharing">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

2. **Upload Source Images**: Upload your 2 images, one must be the content image, and another one will be the style image. Respectively the content image will get the drawing style of the second picture.
add the paths to these files at the end of the last notebook cell:

```content_path = '/content/12472_Comp_E1_ImageA.jpg'
style_path = '/content/download-_1_.png'```
