# Gradio: Simplifying GUI Creation for Machine Learning

## Introduction
Integrating Machine Learning models into user-friendly applications enhances usability and accessibility. Creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is crucial for deploying models as it facilitates interaction and data input. Gradio, an open-source Python package, bridges this gap by enabling Python developers to build GUIs with minimal coding effort. This project explores Gradio's functionalities, demonstrating its capabilities through practical examples.
