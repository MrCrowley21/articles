# Video Object Tracking

## Article Summary
Object Detection and Object Tracking is a quite useful thing for the modern world, especially when talking about solving real-life problems in fields associate with businesses (all of them) like agriculture, robotics, transportation and so on and so forth. This article is meant to make you familiar with the "Detection" and "Tracking" terms, and of course teach you how to implement this terms in code and visualizing.

## Getting Started

For this project, we will be using Python 3.11.3. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Install Requirements**: Install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the 'tracking_with_yolo.py' in your code editor**: Run the `tracking_with_yolo.ipynb` file in your code editor to see the examples in action.

## Source Code Explanation

The code in this folder provides basic examples of how object tracking works (examples with yolo and other algorithm). Let's break down the key components:

- `src/tracking_with_yolo.py`: The .py file that contains the YOLO usage example.

- `src/traffic_signs_tracking.py`: The .py file that contains an example of working with a pretrained yolo.pt model.

- `src/traffic_tracking.py`: A complex video object tracking example where with certain tools, I count the number of cars on the highway.

- `src/runners_with_yolo.py`: A tracker for the runners on a competition.

- `src/runners_with_yolo.py`: A tracker for the runners on a competition.

- `src/images`: Images used for the YOLO and other examples.
