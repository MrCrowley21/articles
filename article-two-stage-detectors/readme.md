## Introduction
Object detection involves identifying and localizing objects in digital images or video frames. This article examines two-stage models, which offer enhanced accuracy compared to one-stage models. We explore their architecture, functionality, and effectiveness in computer vision applications.

## Two-Stage Models Overview
Two-stage models locate objects and predict their classes in two steps:
1. **Region Proposal Network (RPN):** Scans the image to propose potential object regions.
2. **Classifier:** Classifies the proposed regions into specific object classes.

## Models Analyzed
### R-CNN
Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) works by generating region proposals, extracting features, classifying objects, and refining bounding boxes. Despite its accuracy, R-CNN is computationally expensive and slow.

### Fast R-CNN
Fast R-CNN improves upon R-CNN by processing the entire image with a single CNN and using ROI pooling for classification and bounding box regression, leading to faster and more efficient object detection.

### Faster R-CNN
Faster R-CNN further reduces computational costs by using a fully convolutional network for region proposals and feature extraction, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.

### Mask R-CNN
Mask R-CNN extends Faster R-CNN to include pixel-wise instance segmentation, enabling precise object detection and segmentation. It is computationally intensive but offers detailed segmentation results.

## Conclusion
Two-stage models have significantly evolved, becoming more efficient, faster, and requiring fewer resources. The advancements from R-CNN to Mask R-CNN highlight continuous improvements in object detection accuracy and efficiency.
