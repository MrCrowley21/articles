# Example Article: Getting Started with XYZ

Welcome to the example article on getting started with XYZ! In this article, we will walk you through the steps to prepare your environment, create a new project, and build a simple application using XYZ.

## Article Summary

XYZ is a powerful technology that allows developers to build efficient and scalable applications. In this article, we'll cover the basics of XYZ, including environment setup, project creation, and writing a simple XYZ application. By the end of this article, you'll have a solid understanding of how XYZ works and how to start using it for your projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with XYZ:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**: Before you begin, make sure you have a virtual environment set up for your project. If not, create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate      # On Windows: .\myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Install Requirements**: Inside your virtual environment, install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create a New Project**: Use the following commands to create a new XYZ project:

    ```sh
    xyz create my-xyz-project
    cd my-xyz-project
    ```

4. **Run the Application**: To run your XYZ application, use the command:

    ```sh
    xyz start
    ```

5. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your XYZ application in action.

## Source Code Explanation

The source code in this folder provides a basic example of an XYZ application. Let's break down the key components:

- `app.py`: This file contains the main code for your XYZ application. It defines routes and handlers.

- `templates/`: This folder contains HTML templates used by your application's views.

- `static/`: Any static assets like CSS, JavaScript, or images are placed in this folder.

Feel free to explore the source code and make changes to see how it affects your XYZ application.

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully created and run your first XYZ application, consider diving deeper into XYZ's features. You can explore more advanced topics, integrate databases, and build more complex applications.
